To fix the CORS error, please follow these steps:

1. Stop your current backend server (press Ctrl+C in the terminal where it's running)

2. Navigate to the backend directory:
   cd backend

3. Start the server again with:
   uvicorn src.main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000

4. Your backend server will now have the updated authentication code that properly handles OPTIONS requests for CORS preflight checks.

After restarting the server, the CORS error should be resolved.
